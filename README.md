barcodepdf
==========

Add barcode to a template pdf using Python


pdfcreate.py 
  requires an existing 'template.pdf' file to be located in the same directory as the python script. 

snippets.py
  some snippets of code that may be handy for various activities in addition to just creating barcodesinto a pdf template

LIMITATIONS:
* Appears to be only good for single page pdf templates
* cannot figure out how to loop the pdf generation. I.e script must be run each time for each pdf doc intended to be created
